I watched this tonight.
It was quite interesting.

The character Ray Kroc was quite a strong one.
He is ultimately unlikeable and reminds me of Steve Jobs.

There are stories and traits that you might admire.
But then I'm skeptical of bluster in the service of his persistence.
That strikes me as a story from after the fact.

The phrase 'Fortune favours the bold' is used in the film.
I've heard it before but the film made me dwell on it more.
Maybe it is something I should consider more.
I definitely feel that I could use a bit of that, in fairness.
