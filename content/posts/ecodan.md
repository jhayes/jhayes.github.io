## Summary {#summary}

The following is a meandering post on what I've learnt about heat pumps (and more specifically the Ecodan range from Mistubishi).

## Adding a smart sensor {#adding-a-smart-sensor}

It's possible to add a smart sensor to this heating system. The model number I used was 587IF-E.

When I was trying to source this, there was confusion online about the fact that there are multiple variants.
It seems like there's a different part number for Austrialian models (or something).

I bought mine on [eBay](https://www.ebay.ie/itm/284060037125) and it seemed to work fine.

For installation, I used the following videos:

### Pressure Gauge {#pressure-gauge}

-   Previously I had a slight weep in the system. There's a gauge that indicates the pressure of the system.
-   From talking to the plumber and heat pump service guy, keeping it in the range of 1 to 2 bar is what you're looking for, they advise.
