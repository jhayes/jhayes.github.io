Still learning how to use this.

I use emacs a fair bit and org-mode a bit so I'm interested in using an org-mode flow.
It's unclear yet if it's worth the effort for me but I'll give it a go anyways.

I'm currently working my way through a post by a guy called Andreyor.

A list of stuff in this area:
