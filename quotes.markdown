"If you are given a hammer with which to drive nails
at the age of three you may think to yourself, "OK,
nice." But if you are given a hard rock with which to
drive nails at the age of three, and at the age of four

a marvelous invention!" You see, you can't really
appreciate the solution until you first appreciate the
problem."
- Lewis Carroll Epstein
