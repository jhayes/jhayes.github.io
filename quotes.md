Snippets of stuff that I thought were interesting. Some are classic, others are 'new-age'.

> I had a very, very illuminating discussion with the guy in charge of repairs when my kitchen sprung a leak.
> Kitchen layout is constrained a lot by physics, and again by ergonomics, and the customer's theories on how the kitchen should be don't always allow for these. He confessed that the reason they bombard you with a million tile and color and flooring and countertop options is to induce decision fatigue.

> The ceramics teacher announced on opening day that he was dividing the class into two groups. All those on the left side of the studio, he said, would be graded solely on the quantity of work they produced, all those on the right solely on its quality. His procedure was simple: on the final day of class he would bring in his bathroom scales and weigh the work of the "quantity" group: fifty pound of pots rated an "A", forty pounds a "B", and so on. Those being graded on "quality", however, needed to produce only one pot -albeit a perfect one - to get an "A". 
> 
> Well, came grading time and a curious fact emerged: the works of highest quality were all produced by the group being graded for quantity. It seems that while the "quantity" group was busily churning out piles of work - and learning from their mistakes - the "quality" group had sat theorizing about perfection, and in the end had little more to show for their efforts than grandiose theories and a pile of dead clay.

> The Ibis was a sacred bird to the Egyptians and worshippers acquired
merit by burying them with due ceremony. Unfortunately the number of
worshippers greatly exceeded the number of birds dying of natural causes
so the temples bred Ibises in order that they might be killed and and then
properly buried.
>So far as many mathematics students are concerned university mathematics lectures follow the same pattern. For these students attendance at
lectures has a magical rather than a real significance. They attend lectures
regularly (religiously, as one might say) taking care to sit as far from the
lecturer as possible (it is not good to attract the attention of little understood but powerful forces) and take complete notes. Some lecturers give out the notes at such speed (often aided by the technological equivalent of the
Tibetan prayer wheel — an overhead projector) that the congregation is fully
occupied but most fail in this task. The gaps left empty are filled by the more
antisocial elements with surreptitious (or not so surreptitious) conversation, reading of newspapers and so on whilst the remainder doodle or daydream.
> The notes of the lecture are then kept untouched until the holidays or, more
usually, the week before the exams when they are carefully highlighted with
day-glow yellow pens (a process known as revision). When more than 50% of
the notes have been highlighted, revision is said to be complete, the magical
power of the notes is exhausted and they are carefully placed in a file never
to be consulted again. (Sometimes the notes are ceremonially burnt at the
end of the student’s university career thereby giving a vivid demonstration
of the value placed on the academic side of fifteen years of education.)
