      <description>Introduction There are three vents in the house. These are located in the kitchen, downstairs toilet and upstairs bathroom.&#xA;They all look similar but are actually different variants, all designed by Aereco. There is a comparison table located here: https://www.aereco.ie/products/exhaust-units-ie/bxc-2/#characteristics&#xA;Just in case it disappears later, the gist is:&#xA;The bathroom ones have a boost feature when a person is present. The kitchen and bathroom check for humidity (I guess the downstairs toilet won&amp;rsquo;t have much water vapour anyways).</description>

      <description>Starting Points Still learning how to use this.&#xA;I use emacs a fair bit and org-mode a bit so I&amp;rsquo;m interested in using an org-mode flow. It&amp;rsquo;s unclear yet if it&amp;rsquo;s worth the effort for me but I&amp;rsquo;ll give it a go anyways.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m currently working my way through a post by a guy called Andreyor.&#xA;A list of stuff in this area:&#xA;https://andreyor.st/posts/2022-10-16-my-blogging-setup-with-emacs-and-org-mode/ https://diego.codes/post/blogging-with-org/ Adding a new post Go to the home directory and add a new file &amp;lsquo;post_XX.</description>

      <title>Setting up Shelly H&amp;T Plus with Home Assistant</title>

      <description>Introduction I bought two Shelly H&amp;amp;T Plus (version 3) devices a couple of months ago. The reason for choosing them at the time was because:&#xA;They had a legible screen. The company seemed to have a reasonable reputation. There was an option to use the devices without their own apps (as in, local use only). WiFi as a protocol seemed cleaner at the time, less to go wrong. (In the meantime, I don&amp;rsquo;t know if this is so true anymore).</description>
