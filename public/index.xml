      <description>Summary Clickbait title, couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist the obvious one! This page is just a collection of details on the vents in my house for future Jack.&#xA;System There are three vents in the house with differing features. These are then attached to an exhaust fan in the attic via ducts. The exhaust fan is then connected to the outside via an external vent.&#xA;Vents (Exhaust Units) Exhaust units are the devices that pull air out of a room, also called vents.</description>

      <description>Summary This is a list of some niggles and how I deal with them as a reference.&#xA;Deleting the first ‘x’ characters from every line in a region with Emacs. You use your mark tool (‘C-Spc’) to highlight a box area and then use the command ‘C-x r k’ to remove this square/rectangle.&#xA;Don’t worry about the mark tool highlighting the edges of lines in between, they won’t be clipped.</description>

      <description>Summary This page is a summary of stuff I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt about using org-mode with Hugo to publish webpages. It is still very much in flux.&#xA;Starting Points I use emacs a fair bit and org-mode a bit so I&amp;rsquo;m interested in using an org-mode flow. Because I use hugo to generate my website at the moment, use of a package called ox-hugo seemed the most convenient.&#xA;Links Some resources I&amp;rsquo;ve found so far are:</description>

      <title>Setting up Shelly H&amp;T Plus with Home Assistant</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/shelly-handt/</link>

      <description>Introduction I bought two Shelly H&amp;amp;T Plus (version 3) devices a couple of months ago. The reason for choosing them at the time was because:&#xA;They had a legible screen. The company seemed to have a reasonable reputation. There was an option to use the devices without their own apps (as in, local use only). WiFi as a protocol seemed cleaner at the time, less to go wrong. (In the meantime, I don&amp;rsquo;t know if this is so true anymore).</description>

      <description>Summary The following is a meandering post on what I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt about heat pumps (and more specifically the Ecodan range from Mistubishi) and some handy resources I&amp;rsquo;ve found.&#xA;The System The gist of the sytem is shown in the following infographic.&#xA;The Outdoor Unit I&amp;rsquo;m using an 5kW Mitsubishi Ecodan Air to Water Heat Pump. It uses R32 as its refrigerant. It&amp;rsquo;s a Monobloc unit, this means that the refrigerant is all contained outdoors and only water migrates into the house.</description>
