      <description>Starting Points Still learning how to use this.&#xA;I use emacs a fair bit and org-mode a bit so I&amp;rsquo;m interested in using an org-mode flow. It&amp;rsquo;s unclear yet if it&amp;rsquo;s worth the effort for me but I&amp;rsquo;ll give it a go anyways.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m currently working my way through a post by a guy called Andreyor.&#xA;A list of stuff in this area:&#xA;https://andreyor.st/posts/2022-10-16-my-blogging-setup-with-emacs-and-org-mode/ https://diego.codes/post/blogging-with-org/ Adding Images This was the first stumbling block for me.</description>

      <description>Introduction I bought two Shelly H&amp;amp;T Plus (version 3) devices a couple of months ago. The reason for choosing them at the time was because:&#xA;They had a legible screen. The company seemed to have a reasonable reputation. There was an option to use the devices without their own apps (as in, local use only). WiFi as a protocol seemed cleaner at the time, less to go wrong. (In the meantime, I don&amp;rsquo;t know if this is so true anymore).</description>
