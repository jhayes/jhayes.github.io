      <description>Introduction There are three vents in the house. These are located in the kitchen, downstairs toilet and upstairs bathroom.&#xA;They all look similar but are actually different variants, all designed by Aereco. There is a comparison table located here: https://www.aereco.ie/products/exhaust-units-ie/bxc-2/#characteristics&#xA;Just in case it disappears later, the gist is:&#xA;The bathroom ones have a boost feature when a person is present. The kitchen and bathroom check for humidity (I guess the downstairs toilet won&amp;rsquo;t have much water vapour anyways).</description>

      <description>Summary This page is a summary of stuff I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt about using org-mode with Hugo to publish webpages. It is still very much in flux as of &amp;lt;2024-06-28 Fri&amp;gt;.&#xA;Starting Points I use emacs a fair bit and org-mode a bit so I&amp;rsquo;m interested in using an org-mode flow. Because I use hugo to generate my website at the moment, use of a package called ox-hugo seemed the most convenient.</description>

      <title>Setting up Shelly H&amp;T Plus with Home Assistant</title>

      <description>Introduction I bought two Shelly H&amp;amp;T Plus (version 3) devices a couple of months ago. The reason for choosing them at the time was because:&#xA;They had a legible screen. The company seemed to have a reasonable reputation. There was an option to use the devices without their own apps (as in, local use only). WiFi as a protocol seemed cleaner at the time, less to go wrong. (In the meantime, I don&amp;rsquo;t know if this is so true anymore).</description>
