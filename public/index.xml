      <description>Introduction I bought two Shelly H&amp;amp;T plus devices a couple of months ago. The reason for choosing them at the time was because:&#xA;They had a legible screen. The company seemed to have a reasonable reputation. There was an option to use the devices without their own apps (as in, local use only). WiFi as a protocol seemed cleaner at the time, less to go wrong. &amp;ndash; (In the meantime, I don&amp;rsquo;t know if this is so true anymore).</description>

      <description>I watched this tonight. It was quite interesting.&#xA;The character Ray Kroc was quite a strong one. He is ultimately unlikeable and reminds me of Steve Jobs.&#xA;There are stories and traits that you might admire. But then I&amp;rsquo;m skeptical of bluster in the service of his persistence. That strikes me as a story from after the fact.&#xA;The phrase &amp;lsquo;Fortune favours the bold&amp;rsquo; is used in the film. I&amp;rsquo;ve heard it before but the film made me dwell on it more.</description>
