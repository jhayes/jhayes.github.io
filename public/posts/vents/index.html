<p>There are three vents in the house. These are located in the kitchen, downstairs toilet and upstairs bathroom.</p>
<p>They all look similar but are actually different variants, all designed by Aereco.
There is a comparison table located here: <a href="https://www.aereco.ie/products/exhaust-units-ie/bxc-2/#characteristics">https://www.aereco.ie/products/exhaust-units-ie/bxc-2/#characteristics</a></p>
<p>Just in case it disappears later, the gist is:</p>
<ul>
<li>The bathroom ones have a boost feature when a person is present.</li>
<li>The kitchen and bathroom check for humidity (I guess the downstairs toilet won&rsquo;t have much water vapour anyways).</li>
<li>The kitchen one needs to be reset after the powerdown event.</li>
<li>The kitchen one&rsquo;s presence sensor lights up green, unlike the others (as a way of communicating diagnostics, whereas the sensor is used in the other variants).</li>

<ul>
<li>There&rsquo;s a way to measure pressure using a manometer over these vents I believe, so that might be interesting to try in the future.</li>
<li>I think the vents all make their way up to the attic, where there&rsquo;s a much larger exhuast, but I&rsquo;m not completely sure on that yet.
<ul>
<li>At the same time, we also have a vent over the hob but that&rsquo;s venting a different way I think.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I think these vents might also have features for Co2 but I&rsquo;m not sure yet.</li>
