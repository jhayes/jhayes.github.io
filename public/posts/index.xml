<p>Clickbait title, couldn&rsquo;t resist the obvious one! This page is just a collection of details on the vents in my house for future Jack.</p>
<h2 id="vents--exhaust-units">Vents (Exhaust Units)</h2>
<p>Exhaust units are the devices that pull air out of a room (manufacturer&rsquo;s nomenclature).
There are three vents in the house. These are located in the kitchen, downstairs toilet and upstairs bathroom.</p>
<p>They all look similar but are actually different variants, all designed by Aereco.
There is a comparison table located <a href="https://www.aereco.ie/products/exhaust-units-ie/bxc-2/#characteristics">here</a>.</p>
<p>Just in case it disappears later, the gist of it is:</p>
<ul>
<li>The bathroom ones have a boost feature when a person is present.</li>
<li>The kitchen and bathroom check for humidity (I guess the thinking is that a downstairs toilet won&rsquo;t have much water vapour anyways).</li>
<li>The kitchen one needs to be reset after the powerdown event.</li>
<li>The kitchen one&rsquo;s presence sensor lights up green, unlike the others (as a way of communicating diagnostics, whereas the sensor is used in the other variants and doesn&rsquo;t light up).</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h2 id="future-stuff">Future Stuff</h2>
<ul>
<li>There&rsquo;s a way to measure pressure using a manometer over these vents I believe, so that might be interesting to try in the future.</li>
<li>I think the vents all make their way up to the attic, where there&rsquo;s a much larger exhuast, but I&rsquo;m not completely sure on that yet.
<ul>
<li>At the same time, we also have a vent over the hob but that&rsquo;s venting a different way I think.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I think these vents might also have features for Co2 but I&rsquo;m not sure yet.</li>
<li>The vent doors are adjustable I believe, so you can increase the amount of venting.
<ul>
<li>(This could be a trade-off of heat loss vs stagnant air I think, not explored yet).</li>

            <description>Summary This is a list of some niggles and how I deal with them as a reference.
Deleting the first ‘x’ characters from every line in a region with Emacs. You use your mark tool (‘C-Spc’) to highlight a box area and then use the command ‘C-x r k’ to remove this square/rectangle.
Don’t worry about the mark tool highlighting the edges of lines in between, they won’t be clipped.</description>

            <title>Setting up Shelly H&amp;T Plus with Home Assistant</title>
            <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/shelly-handt/</link>
            <pubDate>Tue, 18 Jun 2024 20:54:50 +0100</pubDate>
            
            <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/shelly-handt/</guid>
            <description>Introduction I bought two Shelly H&amp;amp;T Plus (version 3) devices a couple of months ago. The reason for choosing them at the time was because:
They had a legible screen. The company seemed to have a reasonable reputation. There was an option to use the devices without their own apps (as in, local use only). WiFi as a protocol seemed cleaner at the time, less to go wrong. (In the meantime, I don&amp;rsquo;t know if this is so true anymore).</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>I bought two <a href="https://www.shelly.com/en-ie/products/product-overview/shelly-plus-h-and-t">Shelly H&amp;T Plus</a> (version 3) devices a couple of months ago.
The reason for choosing them at the time was because:</p>
<ul>
<li>They had a legible screen.</li>
<li>The company seemed to have a reasonable reputation.</li>
<li>There was an option to use the devices without their own apps (as in, local use only).</li>
<li>WiFi as a protocol seemed cleaner at the time, less to go wrong.
<ul>
<li>(In the meantime, I don&rsquo;t know if this is so true anymore).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>
<p>Just some notes for myself next time I have to set these up..</p>
<ol>
<li>Pressing the button on the back for 5 seconds puts it into a setup mode where the device is a WiFI Access Point.
<ul>
<li>This means that you can connect to it directly via WiFi (as in, it will show up in your list of WiFi networks to connect to).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When this happens, go to the IP address 192.168.33.1.</li>
<li>From here, you then have all sorts of options. In our case, we want to turn on an option called &lsquo;Outbound websocket&rsquo;.</li>
<li>You will give it an address like: ws://192.XXXXX:8123/api/shelly/ws with SSL connectivity set up and a * for the cert.
<ul>
<li>(There&rsquo;s some pickiness here on the capitalization I think, looking at other folks complaints online so keep all lowercase, just in case it&rsquo;s an issue).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When you make changes on the webserver, you&rsquo;ll often have to reboot the temperature sensor, so just be aware of that.
<ul>
<li>Also, because the device goes into sleep mode often, you&rsquo;ll quite likely have to press the button on the device to get these changes to be worked on.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Once that&rsquo;s all done, going back to the server webpage, it should tell you that it&rsquo;s all good now.</li>
<li>Then you go to the Home Assistant webpage and it should add the entity automatically.
<ul>
<li>Again, a restart of Home Assistant seemed necessary here.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

            <title>What I know about Ecodan ASHPs</title>

            <description>Summary The following is a meandering post on what I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt about heat pumps (and more specifically the Ecodan range from Mistubishi).
Map of the Plumbing Adding a smart sensor It&amp;rsquo;s possible to add a smart sensor to this heating system. The model number I used was 587IF-E.
When I was trying to source this, there was confusion online about the fact that there are multiple variants. It seems like there&amp;rsquo;s a different part number for Austrialian models (or something).</description>
