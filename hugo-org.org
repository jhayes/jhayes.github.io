* Starting Points
Still learning how to use this.

I use emacs a fair bit and org-mode a bit so I'm interested in using an org-mode flow.
It's unclear yet if it's worth the effort for me but I'll give it a go anyways.

I'm currently working my way through a post by a guy called Andreyor.

A list of stuff in this area:

- https://diego.codes/post/blogging-with-org/
* Adding a new post
1. Go to the home directory and add a new file 'post_XX.org'.
2. Add a preamble of #commands that can be copied from an old post.
3. Write your post.
4. Use of the command C-c, C-e, H, H.
   - This invokes ox-hugo that will generate the markdown file.
5. Go to a terminal and invoke 'hugo server -D' from the home directory.
6. Marvel at the results located at 'https://localhost:1313'.
  
* Adding Images
This was the first stumbling block for me.
- [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/doc/image-links/][Ox-Hugo Image Links]]
  - Reading over this, put the images you're interested in, in the /static/ directory.
  - Then you can reference them using the file: prefix and various square brackets.
* Adding Tables
Firstly we can add a table by use of comma seperated values.
