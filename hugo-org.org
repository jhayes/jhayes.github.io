#+title: Using Org-Mode with Hugo
#+hugo_tags: hugo emacs

* Summary
This page is a summary of stuff I've learnt about using org-mode with Hugo to publish webpages.
It is still very much in flux as of <2024-06-28 Fri>.

* Starting Points

I use emacs a fair bit and org-mode a bit so I'm interested in using an org-mode flow.
Because I use hugo to generate my website at the moment, use of a package called [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/][ox-hugo]] seemed the most convenient.

Some resources I've found so far are:
- https://andreyor.st/posts/2022-10-16-my-blogging-setup-with-emacs-and-org-mode/
  - Got me up and running initially.
- https://diego.codes/post/blogging-with-org/
- https://lucidmanager.org/productivity/create-websites-with-org-mode-and-hugo/
  - Handy details on front matter.
  - Nice snippet on setting up a lastmod timestamp.
  - Note that he doesn't use ox-hugo.
  
* Adding a new post
1. Go to the home directory and add a new file 'post_XX.org'.
2. Add a preamble of #commands that can be copied from an old post.
3. Write your post.
4. Use of the command C-c, C-e, H, H.
   - This invokes ox-hugo that will generate the markdown file.
5. Go to a terminal and invoke 'hugo server -D' from the home directory.
6. Marvel at the results located at 'https://localhost:1313'.
  
* Adding Images
This was the first stumbling block for me.
- [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/doc/image-links/][Ox-Hugo Image Links]]
  - Reading over this, put the images you're interested in, in the /static/ directory.
  - Then you can reference them using the file: prefix and various square brackets.

* Adding Tables
Firstly we can add a table by use of comma seperated values.

* Themes
I'm currently using the [[https://github.com/rhazdon/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng/][hello-friend-ng]] theme.

* Things to figure out
1. How do I add little hover notes?
2. How do I change the theme properly?
