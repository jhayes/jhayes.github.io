#+title: What I know about Ecodan ASHPs
#+hugo_tags: house heating

* Summary
The following is a meandering post on what I've learnt about heat pumps (and more specifically the Ecodan range from Mistubishi).

* Adding a smart sensor

It's possible to add a smart sensor to this heating system. The model number I used was 587IF-E.

When I was trying to source this, there was confusion online about the fact that there are multiple variants.
It seems like there's a different part number for Austrialian models (or something).

I bought mine on [[https://www.ebay.ie/itm/284060037125][eBay]] and it seemed to work fine.

For installation, I used the following videos:

* Diagnostics
** Pressure Gauge
- Previously I had a slight weep in the system. There's a gauge that indicates the pressure of the system.
- From talking to the plumber and heat pump service guy, keeping it in the range of 1 to 2 bar is what you're looking for, they advise.
